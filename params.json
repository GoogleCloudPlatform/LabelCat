Who taught LabelCat this trick you\r\nask? You did...or rather, you will. Once deployed, you must train LabelCat on\r\npreviously labeled issues, preferably from a variety of well-labeled\r\nrepositories.\r\n\r\nThese instructions show how to run LabelCat on Google Cloud Managed VMs for\r\nmaximum ease-of-use and scalability, but LabelCat can be deployed virtually\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nWhile many Google Cloud Platform Node.js samples are small and simple, focusing\r\non a single concept or piece of functionality, there aren't many full-blown\r\nNode.js apps to look at and tinker with. LabelCat fills the void somewhat by\r\nshowcasing a larger Node.js app that addresses a number of production concerns.\r\nAs such LabelCat is an excellent resource as you build your own production\r\nNode.js applications on Google Cloud Platform.\r\n\r\nBuilt by [@jmdobry][1]\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n\r\n- [What's included](#whats-included)\r\n- [Installation](#installation)\r\n- [Deployment](#deployment)\r\n\r\n## What's included\r\n\r\n- A NodeJS Web API + worker\r\n- An Angular + Material UI frontend\r\n- Deployment instructions\r\n- Detailed documentation of every piece\r\n\r\nAs an exercise, try swapping out the backend or frontend with something you\r\nwrite yourself.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Clone and setup\r\n\r\n1. Install Node.js >= 4.x\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/LabelCat`\r\n1. `cd LabelCat`\r\n1. `npm install`\r\n1. `cp config.default.js config.js` (`config.js` is where you customize the app)\r\n1. Modify `config.js` as necessary.\r\n\r\n### Register Developer Application on GitHub\r\n\r\nLabelCat uses GitHub OAuth to authenticate users. Create an _individual_\r\ndeveloper application if you intend to use LabelCat on repositories owned by\r\nyour GitHub user. Create an _organization_ developer application if you intend\r\nto use LabelCat on repositories owned by an organization that you administer.\r\n\r\n_Individual_ Application: Go to https://github.com/settings/developers to\r\nregister a new individual application.\r\n\r\n_Organization_ Application: Go to\r\n`https://github.com/organizations/<organization>/settings/applications/new`.\r\nReplace `<organization>` with the name of your organization.\r\n\r\n__Register the Application__:\r\n\r\n1. Click \"Register new application\"\r\n1. Enter application name, e.g. `Foo LabelCat`\r\n1. Enter homepage URL, e.g. `https://labelcat.appspot.com/`\r\n1. Optionally enter application description\r\n1. Enter authorization callback URL, e.g.\r\n`https://labelcat.appspot.com/auth/github/callback`\r\n1. Click \"Register application\"\r\n1. Copy the generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret` into the `config.js` file\r\nthat you created earlier\r\n\r\n### Register for Google Cloud Platform\r\n\r\nThe Google Cloud Platform provides a $300 free trial for new accounts, enough to\r\nrun the app for a \"long time\" (TODO: Update for accuracy). \r\n\r\n1. Register at https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial\r\n1. Create a new Project\r\n1. Enable the Predictions API, Datastore API and PubSub API for your new project\r\n1. Go to \"Credentials\", create a new Service Account and download the generated\r\nkey file\r\n\r\n## Deployment\r\n\r\n1. Install the [Google Cloud SDK][2]\r\n1. `gcloud preview app deploy app.yaml worker.yaml --promote`\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nSee [CONTRIBUTING][3].\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2015, Google, Inc.\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0\r\n\r\nSee [LICENSE][4].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/jmdobry\r\n[2]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/\r\n[3]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/LabelCat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n[4]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/LabelCat/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
